## Our Process
Cyber Club London (CCL) follows a highly transparent process to support all founders and entrepreneurs, whether or not we invest in their venture.

### 01. Preliminary Assessment
The first stage focuses on assessing potential startups, ensuring they meet CCL's minimal requirements:
- Product, service, or solution in the cybersecurity industry.
- Proof of Concept (POC) available.
- Seeking early-stage investment (Pre-Seed, Seed, or A-round).

### 02. Collective Diligence
Selected startups are invited to present their vision and demo their product to CCL members. Evaluation criteria include:
- The founding team.
- Total Addressable Market and go-to-market strategy.
- Alignment with CCL member perspectives on industry needs.
- Technological innovation and supremacy.

### 03. Investment
CCL members may choose to invest in a startup. If a sufficient amount of capital is pledged, the investment is made. Additionally, CCL advises other venture capital investors interested in the round.

### 04. Mentoring & Support
Once funded, CCL members (now stakeholders) mentor and support startups, offering technical and strategic advice to foster growth.
